# Thapar Marketplace

## 🛍️ Overview

**Thapar Marketplace** is a dedicated campus-centric platform inspired by **Facebook Marketplace** and **HungerBox**, built to facilitate smooth, secure, and structured trading among students. It introduces two distinct modes:

- **DayMarket** — A campus-wide marketplace.
- **NightMarket** — A hostel-specific, curfew-friendly marketplace.

By offering these distinct environments, we aim to eliminate clutter from informal chat groups and create a reliable space for students to buy, sell, and barter items.

## 💡 Challenges Faced by Students

- Trading is scattered across unorganized WhatsApp groups.
- No platform supports **barter trading** effectively.
- Frequent trust issues due to scams and unreliable buyers/sellers.
- Inability to discover items within the same hostel (especially at night).
- Urgent night-time needs (chargers, snacks, notes, medicines) often go unmet.
- Lack of **safe, designated meetup spots** for transactions during the day.
